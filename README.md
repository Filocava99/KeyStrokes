# KeyStrokes
A clone of the keystrokes feature of the BadLion Client for Minecraft 1.15.2.

To move the HUD press RIGHT-SHIFT and then drag and drop it; when you are done press ESC.

## TODOs
* Mod menu that allows the player to change:
    * transparency of the HUD
    * color of the HUD
    * colors of the CPS counters
* Register a new keybinding for the drag-and-drop feature (currently set on R-SHIFT)

### Notes
That's my first Forge mod, the code may not be very efficient
